# Slidee
Presentation tool powered by [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)

At its core, Slidee turns a folder of markdown files into Reveal.js presentations.

WON'T CURRENTLY WORK ON WINDOWS, SORRY ðŸ˜¢.

## Getting started
- Create a markdown file ending in `.slides.md`, e.g. `test.slides.md`
- Write your content inside that file, e.g.
  - ```md
    Slide 1
    ---
    Slide 2 
    ---
    Slide 3
    ```
- Run `npx slidee` inside the folder containing your markdown file to start the Slidee presentation server (running on port 3000 i.e. http://localhost:3000)

Note that three dashes `---` are special. When you write `---` on it's own line, it indicates the end of one slide and the beginning of the next one.

## Writing slides with presenter notes
Reveal.js has a built in presenter notes view - just hit `s` to show it.

Although Reveal.js allows you to customise which parts of your markdown should be interpreted as presenter notes, Slidee is more opinionated.

In Slidee, notes should appear after the bullet point `- Notes:`. This allows you to visually separate your notes from slide content when you look at the rendered markdown on something like Github. For example:

```md
Slide 1

- Notes:
  A simple note for slide 1

---

Slide 2 

- Notes:
  Some more structured notes
  ## Point
  The point of this slide 
  ## Narrative
  What I want to say on this slide 
  ### Transition
  How will I link to the next slide

---

Slide 3
```

## Customising Slidee 

### Styling
Slidee uses the reveal.js `moon` theme as its default.

To customise the look of your presentations, you can add your own css. Slidee will look for a file named `slidee.css` in the location that you run `npx slidee` and apply those styles on top of the default.

An example that allows you to customise the slide and font colours is:
```css
body {
    background-color: #3c2157 !important;
    color: #fff !important;
}

p,h3,h4 {
    color: #fff !important;
}

h1,h2 {
    color: #ff7999 !important;
}
```

### Running slidee
You can run slidee with arguments. To use the defaults for any argument use the `.` .

`npx slidee {folder} {extension} {locale}`

- `folder` - which folder you want slidee to look for presentations in. Default is the folder you run `npx slidee` from.
- `extension` - what extension do your presentations have? Default is `.slides.md`
- `locale` - slidee uses filenames to create human readable presentation titles. Some languages have have special characters and rules for capitalisation. If you use a non western Latin character set for your filenames then consider specifying a language/locale code (examples avaiable at [ISO Language Code Table](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm)). Default is `en` (English)

Alternatively can also specify options using environment variables in a `.env` file, e.g. 
```
SLIDEE_FOLDER=decks
SLIDEE_REGEX=\.slides\.md$
SLIDEE_LOCALE=en
SLIDEE_PORT=3000
```

Notes:
- `SLIDEE_REGEX` allows you to specify a general regex pattern for your presentations instead of specifying just the file extension as with the command line argument.
- Command line arguments override environment variables


## Miscellaneous
By default, reveal.js takes HTML and turns it into a web based presentation. To see an example:
- Open `examples/html/index.html`

Reveal.js can also take markdown and turn it into a web based presentation. To see an example:
- Open `examples/markdown/index.html`
